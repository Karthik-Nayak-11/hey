                Hey Jennica,
                
                I hope you're doing well. I’ve been feeling a bit of a whirlwind lately, and I wanted to share a few things with you. To be honest, I never thought someone like you or anyone would ever date me. I’ve always had this weird feeling of being unlikeable or something, but you’ve really changed that perspective for me. I’m so grateful for that.
                
                Thinking back to the day we met, it was just amazing. The way things unfolded between us was beautiful—like when you kissed me on the cheek, I was practically floating with butterflies. And even though we had that little fight, it kind of surprised me because it was only a week into our relationship. But, weirdly, I’m glad we did. It felt real, you know?
                
                I have to admit, I’m feeling a bit confused about how to handle things moving forward. I might end up ghosting you or maybe I’ll stay in touch—honestly, I’m not even sure what I’m feeling right now. I wish I had the courage to ask you out for more dates, but I’ve been a bit scared to take that step.
                
                Whatever happens, I want you to know that what we had was really special. I wish we could have spent more time together. Anyway, take care of yourself, Jennica.
                
                Bye for now,
